[Course](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-course/tree/22f_basic) made by Radoslav Neychev
Tasks solved by Marfa Zakirova

## Implemented tasks
### Decision Tree
In this assignment, one had to implement one's own decision tree. There are necessities to write the process of building, optimizing, and predicting.

### Neural network from scratch
The goal is to implement all the basic blocks of the nn in pure numpy. It means to build layers, loss functions, optimizers, etc. in the modules.ipynb

### Lab 2: Dealing with overfitting
Train a FC network, overfit it, try to deal with overfitting by using regularization techniques (Dropout, Batchnorm, etc.).
