Tasks solved by Marfa Zakirova

## Implemented tasks
### [Decision Tree](https://github.com/marfadita/ML-mipt-basic/blob/main/tasks/0_04_tree/tree_new.py)
In this assignment, one had to implement one's own decision tree. There are necessities to write the process of building, optimizing, and predicting.

### [Neural network from scratch](https://github.com/marfadita/ML-mipt-basic/blob/main/tasks/0_05_nn_from_scratch/modules1.ipynb)
The goal is to implement all the basic blocks of the nn in pure numpy. It means to build layers, loss functions, optimizers, etc. in the modules1.ipynb

### [Dealing with overfitting](https://github.com/marfadita/ML-mipt-basic/blob/main/tasks/lab2/Lab2_DL_part2_overfitting.ipynb)
Train a FC network, overfit it, try to deal with overfitting by using regularization techniques (Dropout, Batchnorm, etc.).
